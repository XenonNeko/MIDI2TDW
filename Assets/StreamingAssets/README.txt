In this folder, you will find the following subfolders:

"about"
    This holds the licenses for the third-party components used by MIDI2TDW.

"config"
    This holds user-customizable configuration files for the application.
    They are in JSON format.
    
"debug"
    If present, this is where debugging information will appear.

"diagnostics"
    This is where Diagnostics Files will end up when you generate them.
    
    When you encounter an issue with the application, I need to be able to reproduce it.
    Once I get the issue to occur on my end, I can see what the program is doing internally and hopefully spot
    what went wrong.
    
    Diagnostics Files contain information compiled from the moment the program started to the moment the
    "Create Diagnostics File" button is pressed. This is referred to as a "session". A session ends when the program
    is closed.
    That means that the Diagnostics File must be created AFTER the issue occurs but BEFORE you close the program, otherwise
    information about the issue will not be present in the Diagnostics File.
    
    So when you encounter an issue, you should do the following for the best results:
        1. Close MIDI2TDW if it is open, then reopen it.
        2. Perform the steps that led to your issue, making sure that it actually occurs.
        3. Generate a Diagnostics File.
    This ensures that the Diagnostics File is not cluttered with too much irrelevant information,
    making the issue faster to track down.
    
    Diagnostics Files contain the following data from your session:
        Log files
            These contain logs of what happened while the application was running,
            including any errors that occurred.
            I can use a log file to help figure out what happened internally while you were using the application.
        Loaded MIDI files
            These are included in case the MIDI file was the cause of the issue.
            If so, I can analyze the file and attempt to convert it myself, maximizing the
            likelihood that I can track down the exact issue you were having.
        Exported Thirty Dollar Website songs
            These are included if the conversion made it to the point of generating a file.
            If so, I can look at what the program generated and compare it to what should have been generated.

"in"
    This is where you put MIDI (.mid) files you want to convert.

"logs"
    This holds logs generated by the program.
    The log file for a session is not written until the application closes.

"out"
    This is where your generated Thirty Dollar Website songs will go.
    Each song will have the same name as the MIDI file it was generated from.
