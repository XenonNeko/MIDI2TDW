# MIDI2TDW
Convert MIDI files to Thirty Dollar Website songs

This tool is in Early Access.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to stop by the [support channel](https://discord.gg/n6vd9E8j4U) on my Discord server.

If your MIDI file fails to convert, you'll need to create and upload a Diagnostics File. Diagnostics Files can be found in `MIDI2TDW_Data/StreamingAssets/diagnostics/`.
