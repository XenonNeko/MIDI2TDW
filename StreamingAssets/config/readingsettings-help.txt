If you're getting an error when trying to load a MIDI file,
check to see if the error message matches an error described by one of the policies below.
If so, try changing the value for that policy in "readingsettings.json".
The most important information in an error message is typically at the top.
Look for the word "Exception" near the top of the error message.

UnexpectedTrackChunksCountPolicy:
    The reaction of the reading engine on unexpected track chunks count.

    The reaction of the reading engine on missed "End Of Track" event.
    The default is "Ignore".
    The default for MIDI2TDW is "Ignore".
    Allowed values for this policy:
        "Ignore" - Ignore missing of the "End Of Track" event and try to read a track chunk relying on the chunk's size.
        "Abort" - Abort reading and throw an "MissedEndOfTrackEventException".

    Allowed values for this policy:
        "NoteOff" - Read an event as "NoteOffEvent".

    The default is "Abort".
    The default for MIDI2TDW is "Ignore".
    Allowed values for this policy:
        "Abort" - Abort reading and throw an "InvalidChunkSizeException".
        "Ignore" - Ignore difference between actual chunk's size and the declared one.

UnknownFileFormatPolicy:
    The reaction of the reading engine on unknown file format stored in a header chunk.
    The default is "Abort".
    The default for MIDI2TDW is "Ignore".
    Allowed values for this policy:
        "Ignore" - Ignore unknown file format and try to read chunks.
        "Abort" - Abort reading and throw an "UnknownFileFormatException".

UnknownChannelEventPolicy:
    The reaction of the reading engine on unknown channel event.
    The default is "Abort".
    The default for MIDI2TDW is "SkipStatusByteAndOneDataByte".
    Allowed values for this policy:
        "Abort" - Abort reading and throw an "UnknownChannelEventException".
        "SkipStatusByte" - Skip only invalid status byte and start next MIDI event reading.
        "SkipStatusByteAndOneDataByte" - Skip invalid status byte and one data byte, and start next MIDI event reading.
        "SkipStatusByteAndTwoDataBytes" - Skip invalid status byte and two data bytes, and start next MIDI event reading.
        "UseCallback" - Use callback to manually decide how reading engine should handle invalid unknown channel event.
            WARNING: MIDI2TDW does not provide a callback for this.

InvalidChannelEventParameterValuePolicy:
    The reaction of the reading engine on invalid value of a channel event's parameter value.

    The default for MIDI2TDW is "ReadValid".
    Allowed values for this policy:
        "Abort" - Abort reading and throw an "InvalidChannelEventParameterValueException".
        "ReadValid" - Read byte and take its lower (rightmost) seven bits as the final value.
        "SnapToLimits" - Read value and snap it to limits of the allowable range if it is out of them.

InvalidMetaEventParameterValuePolicy:
    The reaction of the reading engine on invalid value of a meta event's parameter value.
    The default is "Abort".
    The default for MIDI2TDW is "SnapToLimits".
    Allowed values for this policy:
        "Abort" - Abort reading and throw an "InvalidMetaEventParameterValueException".
        "SnapToLimits" - Read value and snap it to limits of the allowable range if it is out of them.

InvalidSystemCommonEventParameterValuePolicy:
    The reaction of the reading engine on invalid value of a system common event's parameter value.
    The default is "Abort".
    The default for MIDI2TDW is "Abort".
    Allowed values for this policy:
        "Abort" - Abort reading and throw an "InvalidSystemCommonEventParameterValueException".
        "SnapToLimits" - Read value and snap it to limits of the allowable range if it is out of them.

NotEnoughBytesPolicy:
    The reaction of the reading engine on lack of bytes in the underlying stream that are needed to read MIDI data (for example, DWORD requires 4 bytes available).
    The default is "Abort".
    The default for MIDI2TDW is "Ignore".
    Allowed values for this policy:
        "Abort" - Abort reading and throw an "NotEnoughBytesException".
